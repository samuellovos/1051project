# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

### You-Down

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

### Our program will be a program that downloads videos from YouTube. Our ultimate goal is to implement the program into an iOS application.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

### The Youtube downloader will download a video from YouTube and convert it into an .mp4 file. This will be done by taking in the URL of the YouTube video, finding the video within the source code and downloading it. Our Python code will implement a library known as pytube3, which will be able to read YouTube urls and use its own commands. Swift will be used to create the iOS application. PythonKit will be used to implement python into swift. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

### TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#### Our program will download the YouTube video as an .mp4 file, mainly the video.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#### Our program will download the video, capturing both the video and the audio.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#### Our program will download the video, capturing both audio and video, as well as providing information of the video such as title, channel name, and date posted.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

### As we work on our project, we will continue to research how to use pytube and learning the Swift language. We will need to do more testing with Swift and learning how to implement our program into an iOS app. Each member currently is going to do more research and we will constantly be in contact on how to complete our project.
