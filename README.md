## Partner: Andy Cherney

## Overview

### Our project is "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock," a twist on the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This twist is taken from an episode of the Big Bang Theory,
### and adds more options to the game. 

## Difficulties

### Our previous project was "You-Down," a mobile app that would download Youtube videos. However, this proved to be difficult when communication issues arose and one
### of our teammates no longer responded to our messages. Thus, our previous project could not be completed to its greatest capacity and a new route needed to be
### taken. We believed this little twist on Rock, Paper, Scissors would be a fun program to try out.
